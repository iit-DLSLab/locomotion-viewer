# Locomotion-viewer: a tool for visualizing locomotion-related geometric objects
This specializes on top of the ros melodic rviz-visual-tools package to construct geometrical objects related to robotics legged locomotion such as support regions, trajectories and 2D feasibility constraints.

## What you can visualize in Rviz with locomotion-viewer:
- dashed lines
- arbitrary 2D polygons of different colors 
- 3D objects such as tetrahedrons and complex hexahedrons

## ROS dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get  install ros-kinetic-graph-msgs
```

The above dependencies can be installed with the following commands:
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-rviz-visual-tools
```
